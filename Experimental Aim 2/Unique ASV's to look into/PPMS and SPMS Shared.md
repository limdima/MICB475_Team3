## Genus species (# of BLAST hits) --> ASV code 

Coprobacter fastidiosus (5) --> "c9e25d9130359869db0c8fca59bdb623"
  - not well documented

Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (22) --> "899577a10741d336f48d2be23f9b0be7"
  - opportunistic pathogens and have been associated with systemic inflammation
  - presence of Porphyromonas asaccharolytica could indicate a pro-inflammatory shift in the microbiota, contributing to gut dysbiosis and immune activation
  - chronic inflammation driven by proteolytic bacterial activity may exacerbate MS progression, particularly in progressive forms like PPMS and SPMS
  - associated with colon cancer (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/porphyromonas-asaccharolytica)
  - the causative agent of Lemierre's syndrome

Porphyromonas (40) --> "30c4e6e8ec391ad07eb6a1165cf46311"
  - link between Porphyromonas and systemic inflammation is well-documented
  - porphyromonas gingivalis, for example, has been associated with increased systemic inflammation and could play a role in neuroinflammatory conditions by impacting the gut-brain axis
  - could signify an altered microbiota characterized by increased proteolytic activity and inflammation
  - may influence the immune system, leading to enhanced neuroinflammatory processes that are observed in the progressive stages of MS

Alistipes indistinctus (14) --> "a3618e8a69964558653b32f21cfc09c4"
  - SCFA production

Varibaculum cambriense (19) --> "d52a0395431a1912fd52bda732cd2784"

  - protein fermentation

Peptoniphilus (38) lacrimalis (8) --> "58b1c0badb3c55cb6154db46b4571700"
  - protein fermentation, and SCFA and ammonia production
  - Peptoniphilus species are known to produce compounds like isovalerate and putrescine, which can be associated with unpleasant odors and potentially pro-inflammatory states

Peptoniphilus (11) --> "4ed327cbd63f7814eed36b4ec6894867"

Peptoniphilus (38) --> "33b19ddc04e29a0f6c55716d40551ec6"

  - not well documented

Clostridium colinum (14) --> "8a8d6de89853b245e4bc453245789527"
  - has been documented as a pathogen in birds, causing diseases such as ulcerative enteritis
  - not well documented in humans, but genus is often involved in fermentative processes and pathogenic activity
