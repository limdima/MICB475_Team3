# Meeting Agenda
1. Discuss the progress on aim 3 and a final overview of aim 2 figures. 
2. Discuss PPMS and SPMS unique species

# Meeting Notes
* violin plots are good, remove legends and fit all 4 violin plots in one row
* venn diagram, change the colour and set the range 0-60 to increase the visual gradient
* need to perform alpha beta diversity analysis on the MS types, same plot style as the treated/untreated analysis
* find a different way to visually represent the aim 3 aim heatmap results? and manually sift out pathways of interest
  * ^got confused by what Hans and Evelyn and Hans suggested, someone that understood pls update this
  * take average Z scores for control and ms subtype
  * violin plots for top 5 pathways: x axis -> pathways, y-axis -> Z scores
* treated vs untreated violin plots will be supplemental figures
