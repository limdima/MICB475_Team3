# Meeting Notes
* Question: how many samples should we aim for if SRMS = 68 samples, PRMS = 71 samples, total RRMS = 470 if we want to look at them separately? . Answer: Do analysis on all 600 (non-duplicate) samples and then subset 70 samples for each
* Duplicate samples in the data set are taken at different time points.

# To do
* Identify confounding variables and what variables to control for (probiotics)
* Trim down the number of samples
* Create metadata manifest file
