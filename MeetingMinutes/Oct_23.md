# Meeting Agenda
1. Feedback for the proposal (if available)
3. Aim 3 clarification: correlating function back to the indicator

# Meeting Notes
* (Aim 3) Instead of correlation statistics, we could also focus on a qualitative review of the results, discussing the relavent pathways with other literature findings in a discussion section.
* (Aim 1) We can performing alpha and beta analysis on R instead of QIIME2, and if there are commands/code from other online resources that might be useful we can use that in our own research (remember to reference).
   * Could look at previous UJEMI papers to see how they performed similar analysis.
