# Meeting Agenda
1. Review RScript and discuss whether the filtered dataset has enough observations for each ms category (mainly SPMS)
2. Discuss potential confounding variables, and how we can find a balance between keeping samples and reducing confounders (e.g. smoking, treatment)
3. Review next steps and if there are key papers we should read

# Meeting Notes
* Team proposal due October 20th (only one meeting left)
* 30 samples per condition is good enough
* 3 aims (ideas): characterize diversity and composition of gut microbiota across MS subtypes (taxa bar plot), PCoA plots to see if PPMS and SPMS samples cluster together, see effects of other variables, investigate differences of functional groups in microbiotas (indicator taxa associated to MS progression)
* be careful with what figures we want to include (we will need to cut down on a lot of figures)
* have at least 10 samples per condition

# To do
* QIIME2 server to denoise the sequences and generate rarefaction curve
* Come up with a clear research question, hypothesis, and aims (do not limit ourselves with an overly specific research question)
* literature review to determine what variables to explore
* determine who is doing what task and what tasks would be beneficial to go over as a group
* must complete: title, hypothesis, research objectives, experimental aims and rationale (or at least the main bullet points for each section)

# Task delegation
