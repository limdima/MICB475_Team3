# Meeting Agenda
1. Review alpha and beta diversity plots for aim 1 (Aim1 --> Visualizations)

2. Using git and github to pull and push files
# Meeting Notes
* For the boxplots of high-abundance species specific to MS-types (Andrew's plots) try to blast the ASVs to examine the species level. Also, make sure to check the limit of detection.
  * Note the y-axis title (switch to "Taxa")

* For the DeSeq plots, do not need to examine species level by blasting since there are too many.

* Make sure for writing not to make causative sentences, and only use correlative phrases (connecting to literature).

**For the 27th, we need to bring all the data and literature search to move on to writing**
