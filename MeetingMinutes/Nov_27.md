4. Next steps for writing the draft, presentation

# Meeting Notes
* The Aim 1 figure looks good.
* The bar plots should be used as the main figure for Aim 2, except Panel D. The venn diagram can be put into the supplementary.
* The graph for Aim 3 is good, and we should not filter for a lower log-fold change.
  * We also don't need a p-value table necessarily.
  * We might want to do a confidence interval alongside the bar chart, but it is not absolutely necessary.
