# Meeting Agenda
1. Review progress from last week (new filtered phyloseq object, new analyses)
2. Should we/do we know how to use git in R for version and directory control?
3. Questions, any troubleshooting, objectives for next week

# Meeting Notes
*For next week, bring legend and short interpretation of the results
* To stay on track, by November 20th acquire all of the data
* November 13 is during the reading break and optional. Need to discuss if the meeting is needed
* Move all .qza files onto the local computer as a backup in case of issues with the server
* Stick with the same colour scheme for all figures (choose colours that make sense):
  * ColorBrewer2
  * colorblind safe
  * categorical/qualitative colors
* Add a figure legends
* PCoA plot:
  *  The "U" pattern may represent something important (Hans recalls hearing something in the past but is unsure)
  * Confirm significance and if the "golden standard" was used for beta diversity
  * check the richness of the samples and explore which microbial populations were lost
* Consider a bee swarm plot for the shannon_div.png box plot
* Heatmap could be used as a supplemental figure to explain why the specific abundance threshold was set
* Indicator species analysis
  * do not worry too much about the statistics
  * low abundance does not correlate with relevance: look into species even if they are not abundant
